### <span style = "color : darkgreen" > Game Window </span>

On this page, you can see your status at the top-left corner of the game page, and your competitor's status is at the top-right.  
At the bottom of your status, there is a count of your wins, and similarly for your competitor.  
At the top of the page, you can see a round label indicating the current round, which changes after 5 hands.  

Below "Your Wins," there are some rectangles that show the cards you selected in each round. When the round changes, these rectangles are cleared.  

Initially, when you enter the game page, your "status" will be "your turn."  
If your "status" is "first player," you can press the "Card request" button.  
If your "status" is "second player," you won’t be able to use the 
"Card request" button, and your competitor can press it instead.  

During each hand, the player whose "player status" shows "first player" must press the "Card request" button once.  

In each hand, you need to select one of the cards on the playground by clicking on it and then pressing the "send change" button.  

If you want to exchange one of your cards with your competitor, first enter the number of the card you want to change in the line edit opposite 
"enter card you want to change:" and then press the "change request" button.  

When you send your "change request," the information about your card will appear for your competitor in the line edit opposite 
"your competitor wants to give this card:".  

If your competitor does not want to exchange cards, They can press the 
"not changing" button, informing you that They do not want to exchange.  
If your competitor also wants to exchange, They can enter the number of their suggested card in the line edit opposite "enter card you want to change:" and then should press "change request."  
then, to complete the "card replacement", you must press the "Change Card" button and also press the "ok Changing" button.

Once you receive your competitor’s card data in the line edit opposite 
"your competitor wants to give this card:", if you agree with the exchange, you can press "ok changing" and then "change card."  
If you do not agree, you can press "not changing."  

The "show result" button displays the result of each round.  
The "final result" button displays the overall winner after three rounds, determined based on your username shown in your status.  

The buttons "stop_resume" and "exit" are used to pause/resume and exit the game window.  

**<span style = "color : red">And the last tip for this section is this:** </span>**whenever a button is disabled,** **its color will change to brown.**
